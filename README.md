# Synopsis

For converting p4 to git, preserving branches & merges.

# Background

This application, p4-to-git-mergetastic, is for converting a Perforce
(p4) depot into a git repository, with high fidelity. Not only do we map
branches. We also make special effort to represent Perforce copy, branch
and merge actions as merges between git branches. As far as we know,
that sets this tool apart from the alternatives.

This was specifically written for converting Open Watcom 1.9, but could
reasonably be adapted to other depots.

# Usage

Use a Linux machine. The package installation script was tested on
Debian 12, Fedora 38, and Ubuntu 22.04; you may need to tweak it for
other, or newer, distros.

Clone this repository. Then, inside your local copy, run:

```bash
# The installation script will prompt for your password, using sudo:
./build/install-packages.sh
./build/build-dependencies.sh

export P4PORT=server:1666
export P4CLIENT=client
export P4USER=user
export P4PASSWD="password"
./p4-to-git-mergetastic -o repo.git/
```

# Alternatives

Even leaving merges aside, there are not many tools for converting from Perforce
to Git:

* Perforce Git Fusion: proprietary and no longer available.
* [git-p4](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4): slow with large depots.
* Salesforce [p4-fusion](https://github.com/salesforce/p4-fusion):
  incredibly fast, but the work-in-progress branch support was not
  flexible enough for our needs. Nonetheless, p4-fusion is so good we
  use it internally.
